\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Cybersecurity training should be adaptable to evolving cyber threat landscape, be cost effective and most important of all, be integrated well with other components such as enterprise risk management, incident management, threat intelligence and so on. Unfortunately, very few cyber security training platforms can satisfy those requirements. This paper proposes a new model for conducting cyber security trainings with three main objectives: (i) training efforts are initiated by emerging relevant threats and delivered first to respective most vulnerable members (ii) each training session must be
promptly executed (iii) training results must be able to provide actionable intelligence to be employed by other systems such as enterprise risk management, enterprise threat intelligence, etc. The model consists of a data-analytic/machine learning (DA) component and a cyber training delivery (DE) component. DE interfaces with users while DA interfaces with existing cyber security systems and/or databases. Together, DE and DA empower each other, forming a feedback loop that allow all previously-stated objectives to be met.

\section{Introduction}
Cyber awareness training (CAT) is challenging because the knowledge domain is defined by both the defenders and the attackers. Most CATs aim at being compliant rather than proactive, and there has been no research on integrating CAT with other components of a defense-in-depth strategy in a corporation. For example, there is no robust mechanism to integrate CAT with Risk management, threat modeling and even with cybersecurity operation centers. Therefore, this paper proposes a new CAT strategy focusing on speed and efficiency.

InCAT stands for "Intelligence-based Cyber Awareness Training" with the main concept of "training only on the most important emerging cyber security issues based on intelligence and for actionable intelligence." The feedback loop starts with a threat intelligence feed (IBM X-force) where the most recent cyber threats will be analyzed. Associated attack vectors (AVs) will be identified. Recent reports from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) will be parsed and feed into machine learning models to identify the current severity of each AV. This angle will be called "Technical Severity". Also from the identified AVs, quizzes will be designed and sent to random employees (samples) within a company (population). Other machine learning models will be used to analyze responses, resulting in a list of vulnerabilities for which employees are least prepared. This angle will be called "Human Weakness". The focus of the loop's training effort will be the most urgent issue which will be calculated based on both technical severity and human weakness. Another round of quizzes will be designed on the issue, delivered, and evaluated. At this point, the loop goes back to the beginning.

The main research question is about the effectiveness of this new strategy which can be broken down to: (1) Is this strategy accurate? (2) Is this strategy fast? (3) Is this strategy repeatable? In order to provide answers to those three questions, the paper plans to execute the following main mile stones. First, a detailed description of the procedure will be provided with steps, and within each step, there will be sections of precondition, execution, and post-condition. Second, the total time spent on each step such as quiz development time, machine learning model design time, time taken to finish quizzes, etc will be carefully recorded. Third, cross-checking strategies will be employed for both machine learning model quality assurance and quiz results verification. 

The research goals include: (1) Able to use machine learning models to correlate employees' concepts (what they think they know), skills (what they actually know), and threat landscape (NVD reports) to identify which is the most vulnerable attack vector among the emerging attack vectors;  (2) Able to design and deliver quiz-based training materials in a short period of time;  (3) Able to prove the effectiveness of the training materials in improving the awareness relating to the vulnerable attack vector.

\section{Background}
Human is the weakest link in any cyber defense strategy. 78\% of cyber incidents were caused by careless humans \cite{20172017Overview}. The process of cyber awareness training is full of challenges. First, the threat landscape is evolving rapidly with both internal factors (technology changes, business flows changed, etc) and external factors (changes in supply chain, compliance, competitors, enemies, political climates, etc) \cite{Ingalsbe2008ThreatEnd, Manadhata2011AnMetric}. To make things worst, there is no agile cooperation between cyber awareness education and other departments. 

Second, knowledge is not always translated into correct actions. For example, people who know the types of phishing are not completely immune from actual phishing. Training materials are more focused on teaching the knowledge rather rather the skills of applying the knowledge. Consequently, tests are developed to test just the knowledge, in which case learners are well aware that they are being tested and consciously put their guards on. It is very hard to simulate real world scenarios.

Finally, it is challenging to prepare people for potential unknown threats that have not happened yet, not mentioning cyber adversaries are incredibly creative, sometimes state sponsored.

Abawajy \cite{Abawajy2014UserMethods} did a research on user preference of cyber security awareness methods of text-based, video-based and game-based among 60 participants. Even with a "low-tech" appearance, the performance of text-based education is on par with other "fancy" methods. Employees with work deadlines and projects actually prefer light-weight cyber security awareness delivery method that does not get in the way of their main jobs.

Pawlowski \cite{Pawlowski2016SocialDesign} presented a way to use data analytic to map learners' perceptions toward cyber security topics. The idea is to find out what learners care most/less, what learners are missing, and what can be leveraged to motivate learners to learn more. It was discovered that learners do have good exposures to several cyber security key terms and concepts, care very much about cyber security topics that may affect them personally, while missing a lot of the bigger picture involving national cyber infrastructure and cyber terrorism.

Wei \cite{Wei2017IntegratingAssessment} adopts concept mapping (CM) as a tool to enhance the teaching and evaluating of Information System courses. By analyzing the topology of student CMs, instructors can design CM-based tasks, and grade student CMs against a master CM. While it was not explicitly mentioned in the paper, comparing CM is a very interesting way to identify how the concept map of a student can be changed over time, by education and other factors.


\section{Methods and Results}
\subsection{Literature review - end by 15OCT}
Research papers to be reviewed include but are not limited to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item User preference of cyber security awareness delivery methods \cite{Abawajy2014UserMethods}
\item Social Representations of Cybersecurity by University Students and Implications for Instructional Design \cite{Pawlowski2016SocialDesign}
\item Integrating Concept Mapping into Information Systems Education for Meaningful Learning and Assessment \cite{Wei2017IntegratingAssessment}
\item Improving Attention to Security in Software Design with Analytics and Cognitive Techniques \cite{Whitmore2017ImprovingTechniques}\
\item Security Awareness and Affective Feedback : Categorical Behaviour vs . Reported Behaviour \cite{ShepherdSecurityBehaviour}
\item Reports Reveal Four Cyber Security Trends-and the Need for Better Cyber Security Training Awareness \cite{Supra2016ReportsAwareness}
\item PLAYGROUND: preparing students for the cyber battleground \cite{Nielson2017PLAYGROUND:Battleground}
\item Cybersecurity Education: Bridging the Gap Between Hardware and Software Domains \cite{Lukowiak2014CybersecurityDomains}
\item Phishing Educational Framework \cite{RakhraAsstPHISHINGKaur}
\item Challenges and reflections in designing Cyber security curriculum \cite{Pereira2017ChallengesCurriculum}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Base-line survey campaign - end by 20OCT}
The survey is Qualtric-based, and has around 15 carefully crafted questions collecting basic demographic data, conceptual knowledge, and actual cyber security awareness knowledge about emerging threats. Conceptual knowledge was surveyed in two ways: (i) participants were asked to give three words about the products that can be targeted by hackers, (ii) Participants were given a list of possible entry points (such as email, mobile games, etc) and were asked to give two pairs of entry points. It is important to note that no further details or hints were given and participants make the decisions based on their conscious or unconscious conceptual links between the terms.

Six cyber security awareness questions were given. Each question was based on IBM X-force threat intelligence report, in the form of two images and the participants will be asked to choose the image that they think is malicious (only one among two images is an actual screen shot of the corresponding threat). Up to the moment, there are 129 recorded entries. The actual survey can be accessed online \footnote{$https://ncsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0kapSpiqqgoKPT7$}. At the moment, there are 129 recorded attempts performed by participants from the finance and healthy industries. Preliminary report can also be viewed online \footnote{$https://ql.tc/Nhs8XT$}.

\subsection{Analyzing base-line results & Design quizzes - end by 15NOV}
Machine learning models (IBM Watson and/or IBM Cognos Analytic) will be used to analyze the collected results and predict the most vulnerable attack vector. Qualtrics API will be used to let IBM machine learning models update the data automatically as entries are being recorded. Machine learning models will analyze the first conceptual set (the three keyword set), then the second conceptual set (the two pair set). Results (expecting a total maximum of four AVs) given by the machine learning models will be checked against the quiz performance (true/false in each of the six cyber security questions).

CSC522 team will perform machine learning tasks on the NVD reports and come up with their own most vulnerable attack vectors. Finally, identified attack vectors from both perspectives will be paired and the system will decide the most vulnerable attack vector that requires immediate actions.

\subsection{Run quiz campaigns - end by 30NOV}
Light-weight educational quizzes will be distributed to the MTurkers who participated in the base-line campaign. The content of the quizzes will be based on the identified most vulnerable attack vectors (2). The quizzes will utilize adaptive mechanism (conditional branching) provided by the Qualtrics system. 

\subsection{Second base-line survey campaign - end by 05DEC}
The same survey structure that were used for the initial base-line campaign will then be used again for this phase and will be made available to both of baseline round 1 participants and new participants. The same category of knowledge (involving the same attack vectors) will be tested. If the training works, baseline round 1 participants will at least do better on questions regarding the attack vector that they were trained on. Comparison metrics include mean score, max score, average time spent on the question, number of clicks while doing the question.

\subsection{Finish research paper - end by 08DEC}
Final research paper will be finished by 08DEC and be submitted to a suitable conference in January or February of 2019. Due to the multi-disciplinary of the paper, it can be submitted to conferences about either education, Information Technology or Cybersecurity. Raw survey data together with polished reports will also be made available via Github.

\section{Analysis}
Regarding conceptual knowledge, preliminary results show good signs of the separation between core knowledge and perimeter knowledge. For example, "email", "phone", "computer" emerged to be at the core within the 3 vulnerable product group while "website", "account", "network", etc appeared to be on the perimeter. The distinction is not that clear when it comes to the 2-pair group. Further analysis will be applied for a clearer understanding of this difference. It is also important to note that the purpose and nature of the 3-keyword group and the 2-pair group are a little bit different. The 3-keyword group allows participants complete freedom to state whatever concept they have in mind while the 2-pair group is more structured and controlled.

Regarding cyber security awareness knowledge, recognizing malicious Windows OS file execution attack vector has the highest fail rate (63\%) which appears to be consistent with holes in the conceptual knowledge. Most participants have good (core) knowledge about phone, websites, and some general computer topics but Windows OS and its system prompts. 

\section{Conclusions}
The project is on time despite slow participation rate in base-line survey campaign of which deadline was pushed back from 20OCT to 30OCT. Instead of concept mapping as originally proposed, machine learning models will be trained and will automatically identify the attack vector(s) that needs attentions. That phase will be finished by 15NOV leaving two weeks for the training quiz campaigns ending in 30NOV (the original deadline). Providing that the machine learning models work, two weeks will be enough to deliver and analyze two rounds of training quizzes and still meet the depth needed considering the limited scope of this paper. K-fold method will be used to check the models' results.

% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
